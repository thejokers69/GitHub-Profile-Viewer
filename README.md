## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & SOLID Principles

This project is a showcase of the SOLID principles in frontend JavaScript:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class (model, API, renderer, UI, etc.) has one job
- **Open/Closed**: Renderers and services are extensible without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: All renderers can be swapped (loading, error, HTML)
- **Interface Segregation**: Only relevant methods are exposed to each class
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level logic depends on abstractions, not details

See `script.js` for a fully documented, OOP, SOLID-compliant implementation.
